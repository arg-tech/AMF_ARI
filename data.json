  "text": "Dungeons and Dragons is essentially a feeding program for occultism and witchcraft. For Christians, the first scriptural problem is the fact that Dungeons and Dragons violates the commandment of I Ths. 5:22 \"Abstain from all appearance of evil.\" Much of the art, figurines, and writing within Dungeons and Dragons certainly appears evil to say the least of it. On top of that, the second issue is that the materials themselves contain magical rituals. From my own experience as a witch high priest (Alexandrian tradition) during the period 1973-84, I can tell you that, for the most part, the rituals are certainly authentic. If a person \"innocently\" works an authentic ritual that conjures up a demon, or curses someone, thinking that they are only playing a game, the ritual will still have efficacy. If you play at shooting your friend in the head with what you think is an unloaded pistol and don't know a shell is in the chamber, is your friend any less dead because you were playing? Of course, some people will say: \"It's just a game!\" But like the people who think they can play around with crack or pre-marital sex and not get burned by death, AIDS or pregnancy, the person who thinks they can mess with Dungeons and Dragons without getting burnt is whistling in the dark. Thus, in my mind, there is no doubt that Dungeons and Dragons and its imitators are right out of the pit of hell. No Christian or sane, decent individual of whatever faith really should have anything to do with them.",

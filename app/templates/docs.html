<h1> Argument Mining Framework: Argument Relation Identification module (AMF-ARI).</h1>

<h3> Functionality: Predict AIT argumentative relations between pairs of propositional argumentative nodes (I). The predicted relations are: Inference (RA), Conflict (CA), Rephrase (MA), and None.</h3>

<p> <b>Expected Input:</b> xAIF file containing the segmented and pre-processed propositional argumentative nodes (I). </p>

<p> <b>Expected Output:</b> xAIF file with the complete propositional argument graph. For each predicted argumentative relation, a new node (RA, CA, or MA), and two edges (from I<sub>1</sub> to new node, from new node to I<sub>2</sub>) are added to the input xAIF file.</p>
